            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>LAST Night we received an Expreſs from the North with Letters of the 11th. Inſtant, which given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> having marched away from the Town of <hi>London-Derry</hi> as ſoon as the Succours arriv'd, and intending to Attack the <hi>Enniskilling</hi> Men by the way, the Proteſtants were too quick for them, 4000 of that Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon marching out to meet them, and engaging them, routed them, and kill'd 4000 on the Spot, taking 14 of their Great Guns, all their Ammunition and Baggage, many Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and amongſt them were <hi>Juſtin Maccarty</hi> and Col. <hi>Hamilton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This News is likewiſe confirmed from <hi>Dublin,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Particulars; as, that as ſoon as the Duke of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> arrived at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and gave an Account to the late K. <hi>James</hi> of this Defeat, he was in ſo great a Conſternation, that he ſuddenly called all the Proteſtants that were in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> together, giving them Arms, and telling them how he found he had miſtaken his true Intereſt, and deſired them to ſtand by him, and he would defend them in their Rights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whilſt this was doing, a Regiment of <hi>French</hi> Horſe advanced towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> who commanded them to lay down their Arms and diſperſe, or elſe threatned to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and fire that City: Upon which K. <hi>James</hi> told them, how Unhappy he was, that his Circumſtances would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46514:2"/>not allow him to follow what he deſired, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to deliver up their Arms, and ſeparate themſelves: To which they anſwered, That they would diſperſe; but to deliver up their Arms, were alſo to deliver up their Lives, and therefore could not do it. After this, there came thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Captains of the Royal Regiment of Foot, who were the only ſurviving Captains of 24 at the Engagement at <hi>Enniskilling,</hi> who flung up their Commiſſions, and ſaid, they would Serve no longer. This was extreamly ſurprizing to the late King <hi>James,</hi> who anſwer'd, He was a ſecond time betray'd; and therefore gave immediate Orders, that all the Souldiers about <hi>Dublin</hi> ſhould be ready to March. So next Day he march'd out of <hi>Duhlin</hi> with 8000 Men, and coming to <hi>Clomnell,</hi> he received two Expreſſes one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another: The firſt was from <hi>Kingſale,</hi> to give him Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> was upon the Coaſt with his Fleet, and that he intended to Land and take the Fort. which he would certainly do, if they had not immediate Succours. He then thought of marching away directly towards <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi> but ſoon after came another Expreſs, to give him Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> was ſail'd out of <hi>Cheſter</hi> with all his Forces, and that he ſtood Northward towards <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> or that way. This put him in ſo great a Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he march'd way towards <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear now every hour where Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> has landed.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> Governour of <hi>London-Derry,</hi> deſigns for <hi>England,</hi> to give His Majeſty an Account of his Behaviour in that place, having now ſo miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his Country by his undaunted Courage and Conduct, and freed them from all their Enemies, who were ready to ſwallow them up, who will undoubtedly find a fit Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe for his Signal Services.</p>
